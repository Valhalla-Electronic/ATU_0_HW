# ATU_0_HW

HF Antenna Tuner for Radio Amateurs, inspired by OK1FIG:

- LC- or CL-type antenna tuner, software selectable
- 256 capacitance values: 0..2.5 nF in steps of 10 pF
- 256 inductance values: 0..15 ÂµH in steps of 60 nH
- controlled by an Arduino Nano
- powered by a USB power bank
- low current consumption (25..45 mA) by using bistable relays
- remote control via Bluetooth
- simple user interface using, e.g., the Android app "serial bluetooth terminal" by Kai Morich
- 10 memory buttons for recalling setups for different frequency bands
- open source hardware, open source firmware
